* Enter the wiki

  A simple implementation of a GraphQL API to query for guns and other lovely stuff from enter-the-gungeon.

  The aim is to build that knowledge base as I dive into the gungeon (and TS/GraphQL).

** How?

*** To run

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    docker build . -t enter-the-wiki:0.1.0
    docker run enter-the-wiki:0.1.0
    #+END_SRC


*** To develop

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   #+END_SRC

   Thanks to ts-node-dev, the server will auto reload when a file will get updated.
